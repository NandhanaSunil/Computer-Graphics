# Rasterisation Model

## This is a work I have done with Abhirami. R. Iyer for our assignment for the course CS5024, Fundamentals of Computer Graphics @ IIT Palakkad.

This program consists of the following files:
    - cube_grid.cpp
    - gl_framework.cpp
    - gridcube_fs.glsl
    - gridcube_vs.glsl
    - shader_util.cpp
    - shader_util.hpp
    - Makefile
        - Makefile.mac
        - Makefile.win

### To run this program, 
### enter 'make win' for ubuntu,
### or enter 'make mac' for macOS
### followed by running the executable 'cube_colors'

The following are the functionalities in this program with their corresponding key presses:
    - L -> rotate the grid from left to right
    - T -> rotate the grid from top to bottom
    - R -> rotate the grid from right to left
    - D -> rotate the grid from bottom to top

    - Left key - move the cube inside the grid from left to rigt
    - Right key - move the cube inside the grid from right to left
    - Up key - move the cube from bottom to top
    - Down key - move the cube from top to bottom
    - U -> move the cube from front to back
    - B -> move the cube from back to front

    - C - change the color of the cube
    - F - fill a cube grid with a color
    - W - clear a cube grid already filled with color
